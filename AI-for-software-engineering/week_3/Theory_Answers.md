Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch
**TensorFlow:**
- Developed by Google, production-ready
- Static computation graph (though eager execution available)
- Strong deployment tools (TFX, TensorFlow Serving)
- Better for large-scale production systems

**PyTorch:**
- Developed by Facebook, research-friendly
- Dynamic computation graphs (more intuitive debugging)
- Pythonic syntax, easier to learn
- Preferred for rapid prototyping and research

**When to choose:**
- TensorFlow: Production deployment, mobile/edge devices
- PyTorch: Research, academic projects, when debugging is priority

 Q2: Jupyter Notebook Use Cases
 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perfect for step-by-step data inspection with inline visualizations and markdown explanations.

2. **Teaching/Documentation:** Combines executable code, results, and explanations in shareable format for tutorials and reports.

Q3: spaCy vs String Operations

spaCy provides **linguistic understanding** vs basic string matching:
- Understands context: "Apple fruit" vs "Apple company"
- Handles part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
- Pre-trained models recognize entities, relationships
- More accurate for real-world language vs simple keyword searches

Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

| Aspect | Scikit-learn | TensorFlow |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Target Applications | Classical ML (SVMs, Decision Trees) | Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs) |
| Ease of Use | Very beginner-friendly, consistent API | Steeper learning curve, more complex |
| Community Support | Strong data science community | Massive industry and research support |
